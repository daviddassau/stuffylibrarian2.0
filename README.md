# Stuffy Librarian 2.0
The new and improved Stuffy Librarian, a mixed-media inventory tracker, developed as a mobile application!

Stuffy Librarian was originally developed by me, David T. Dassau, as a single-user application for the full-stack capstone project I needed to complete in order to graduate from the Nashville Software School. Original functionality included:

- Adding a new media item to your inventory, via the iTunes API. These could be books, DVDs, Blu-Rays, CDs, vinyl, etc.
- A user had full CRUD capabilities with their inventory. They could edit any aspect of an existing item, view all inventory or a specific item, or remove an item from their inventory permanently.
- There were two cornerstones of Stuff Librarian that would potentially set it apart from other personal inventory trackers:
  - A user could keep track of the items they lent to family and friends. Before they lent the item out, they could make note of the item's condition, the individual they were lending it to, and any other notes they wanted to make.
  - do that
