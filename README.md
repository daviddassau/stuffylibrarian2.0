# Stuffy Librarian 2.0
The new and improved Stuffy Librarian, a mixed-media inventory tracker, developed as a mobile application!

Stuffy Librarian was originally developed by me, David T. Dassau, as a single-user application for the full-stack capstone project I needed to complete in order to graduate from the Nashville Software School. Original functionality included:

- View the Homepage which included your most recently added items. The user could also view in chart-form how many of each media type they own, and how many of each media type they have leant out.
- Adding a new media item to your inventory, via the iTunes API. These could be books, DVDs, Blu-Rays, CDs, vinyl, etc.
- A user had full CRUD capabilities with their inventory. They could edit any aspect of an existing item, view all inventory or a specific item, or remove an item from their inventory permanently.
- There were two cornerstones of Stuff Librarian that would potentially set it apart from other personal inventory trackers:
  - A user could keep track of the items they lent to family and friends (That's how I came up with the name ðŸ˜‰). Before they lent the item out, the user could make note of the item's condition, the individual they were lending it to, and anything else they would like to make note of.
  - A user could also keep track of the items that they had sold. They could log when the item was sold, who it was sold to, and how much money they made from it (optional).
  - Both the lend and sold feature are meant to serve a similar purpose, which is to help a user keep track of the items that are not currently in their possession.
