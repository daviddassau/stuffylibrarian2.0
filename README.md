# Stuffy Librarian 2.0
The new and improved Stuffy Librarian, a mixed-media inventory tracker, developed as a mobile application!

Stuffy Librarian was originally developed by me, David T. Dassau, as a single-user application for the full-stack capstone project I needed to complete in order to graduate from the Nashville Software School. Original functionality included:

- Adding a new media item to your inventory, via the iTunes API. These could be books, DVDs, Blu-Rays, CDs, vinyl, etc.
- do that
